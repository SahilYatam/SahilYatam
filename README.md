# Hey, I'm Sahil 👋

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer from Mumbai, just learning by doing — building real stuff, solving problems, breaking things, and figuring out how to fix them.

I'm especially into backend development, clean architecture, and systems that actually scale and work well. I don’t come from a CS background, but I enjoy the process of learning by building and getting my hands dirty.

Always exploring new tools, trying to write better code, and working on becoming a solid developer one step at a time.

## 🌱 What I'm about
- Backend-heavy development with Node.js
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Redux tool kit
- Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Architecture: microservices, modular monoliths, whatever makes sense

## 📍 Based in
Mumbai, India 🇮🇳

## 🤝 I'm open to
- Internships
- Collaborations on interesting full-stack or backend projects
- Entry-level opportunities
